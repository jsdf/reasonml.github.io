title: Editor Plugins
---

Reason's nature lends itself to great editor support. Most of our editor plugins provides at minimum:

- Types display.
- Programmatic code formatting through `refmt`.
- Errors & warnings display.
- Syntax highlighting.
- Type-driven autocomplete.
- Jump to definition.

And other features.

## Officially Supported Editors

**Note:** You'll also need to install the [reason-cli](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-cli) tools and have them on your PATH for these integrations to work.

- [VSCode](https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server): **recommended**.
- [Atom](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/atom-ide-reason)
- [Vim/Neovim](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vim-reason-plus)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/sublime-reason)
- [IDEA](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reasonml-idea-plugin)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reason-mode): **this is currently unmaintained**. We'd like to upgrade it to [reason-language-server](https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server) one day. Contribution welcome!
