Take a look around!</p>\n<h3>New ReasonReact version released</h3>\n<p>June 12, 2017</p>\n<p>Very exciting release! Short version: ReasonReact now has its own documentation site <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/">here</a>. Accompanying this is the new <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform">BuckleScript</a> release. Both are non-breaking.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<h3>Spring Cleaning (First Blog Post!)</h3>\n<p>May 18, 2017</p>\n<p>Now that the community is taking off, keeping folks up-to-date through <a href="https://discord.gg/reasonml">Discord</a> and other existing channels became less ideal. We\'re starting a blog post section for this reason. In the spirit of the community, these posts will stay short and concise.</p>\n<p>We\'ve moved unused first-party projects from <a href="https://github.com/reasonml/">GitHub/reasonml</a> to <a href="https://github.com/reasonml-old">GitHub/reasonml-old</a>. Old URLs are redirected, so no breackage here.</p>\n<p>We\'ve cleaned up the Reason codebase. Editor integrations moved out to their dedicated repos. Updated instructions are still <a href="./tools.html#editor-integration">here</a>. Other Reason repo cleanups are still ongoing.</p>\n<p>Some discord rooms got merged together. Fewer rooms, more focused discussions.</p>\n<p>As you can see: this documentation site got a few rearrangements too. In general, if you\'d like to contribute to docs, please ping us on Discord!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Blog"}}}},pathContext:{section:"community",sectionTitle:"Community",relativePath:"community/blog.md",relatedFiles:"/^community\\/.*\\.md$/"}}}});
